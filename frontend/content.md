##Balázs
Graduated at the Metropolitan Univerity of Budapest. I consider myself to be an optimistic person. I have several hobbies as football, gym and Rubik's Cube. Regarding music I like hip-hop, my favourite artist is J. Cole. I really like the latest book of Jordan Peterson, although I am not a big reader. Good Will Hunting and Intouchables are the two films I like the most. The series I would recommend to watch would be Peaky Blinders and Suits.

##András
I'm a optimistic, cheerful, sociable person. I like many forms of humor, but I can be serious. I like working in a team, but working alone also goes.
I have visited several countries in Europe (Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Spain, Slovakia, Croatia, Montenegro, Romania, Russia), I have lived in America for three months (Ohio), but I am best connected to the Balaton Uplands and the Danube Bend.
I am proud that I dared to change if I had to. And I am proud of my family.
My musical orientation covers mainly different areas of European music (medieval, late romanticism, 20th century), folk music and jazz. My favorite movies: Cat Catcher, The Adventures of Snow White, Picasso, The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit Trilogy. My favorite works of fiction are the poetry of Dr. Fausta Mann, W. Ivan Ivanhoe, Attila József and Sándor Weöres.
